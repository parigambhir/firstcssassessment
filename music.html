        <h3>Choir</h3>
        <p>
          When Shannze was a little, they used to put on singing shows for their
          parents around the house and soon their parents noticed their singing
          talent. Shaanze was soon put into choir at the age of 7 in grade 2,
          where they continued to sing up until present day. They have always
          loved going to choir and it has been a huge part of their life which
          has also allowed them to be able to start creating their own songs.

        <h3>Guitar & Creating Music</h3>
        <p>
          Just before the lockdown, Shaanze had been learning guitar in their
          guitar class. They started to learn their favourite songs on the
          guitar and soon realized that they could too try to make their own
          songs. When lockdown came around, it was the perfect opurtunity for
          them to start and so they did. They started out by writing lyrics
          about their own life and soon they made a few songs. They were able to
          find a creative outlet for themselves and a way to express themselves
          through music which had already been a big part of their life.

        <h3>Music Tastes</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout their life music was very important, from their homelife to
          going to choir music was always around them which let them have a very
          wide understanding of what music was and lead them to what their music
          taste is now. Another factor that allowed them to explore so many
          different types of genres of music was their older brother who was the
          first person to introduce Shaanze into the dark and grungy music they
          listen to now. From scream rap to indie rock to even some classical
          pieces, Shaanze's music taste has a lot of variety and is definetely
          something that is more than just an interest.
