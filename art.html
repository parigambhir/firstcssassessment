          From a young age, Shaanze was naturally gifted when it came to art and
          had not taken any art lessons until a grade 9 art class. This is what
          led them to expirement with different mediums and what let them find
          their own personal drawing style. Below you can find a few of Shaanzes
          latest art works.
